# Angular + Tensor 
Future of UI is in hands of Ai is proven correctly here ðŸ˜„ .
1) These days zoom , google meet etc such video calling apps are mostly used , 
I wanted to know how bluring and virtual background are implemented.
2) Being huge fan of Ironman , I also wanted to control whats available on screen just with gestures , so implemented swipe gesture and todo list (move in list , check and uncheck ) (need to try lot more  ðŸ˜„)

Thankfully,Tensor js which is developed by google helped me solve problem without need of backend much.
